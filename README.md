Data Collection & Understanding
The dataset includes employee details such as age, education level, years of experience, job title, industry, location, and salary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data analysis is performed to understand salary distribution, identify trends, and analyze the impact of experience, education, and job role on salary.

Data Preprocessing

Missing and inconsistent values are handled.

Categorical variables (job role, education, location) are encoded into numerical form.

Numerical features are scaled where required.

Feature Engineering & Selection
Important features such as total experience, skill level, and job category are selected or engineered to improve prediction accuracy.

Model Development
Regression-based machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting are trained to learn the relationship between input features and salary.

Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared to measure prediction performance.

Salary Prediction
The trained model predicts salaries for new candidate profiles based on their attributes.

Conclusion
The project provides data-driven salary estimates, helping organizations design fair compensation and candidates understand market expectations.
